This is my first blog post. 

I created this site using Gatsby, following 
this [tutorial](https://dennytek.com/blog/personal-site-with-gatsby-part-1). 
It was a good learning experience. I had used React a lot, but not really graphql.
It's pretty amazing how you can make almost anything a data source.
