# personal-site
> portfolio site built with Gatsby

This is a basic portfolio site for myself, built as an excuse to learn Gatsby.

## Prerequisites

- Node
- Python
- Visual Studio with C++ Desktop stuff (for sharper image plugin)

## Installing / Getting started

Clone project, then

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!
    
_Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

### Building

```shell
npm run build
```
